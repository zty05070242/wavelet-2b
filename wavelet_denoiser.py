Wavelet denoising utilities.

Two entry points:
  - wavelet_denoise():         global (full-series) denoising, USES FUTURE DATA.
                               Offline / research only. Never inside a backtest signal.
  - rolling_wavelet_denoise(): causal rolling-window version. Slow but honest.
                               Live-tradeable: only past data is ever used at time t.

The core recipe is the classic Donoho-Johnstone universal threshold:
  1. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the signal into coarse
     approximation + a pyramid of detail coefficient bands.
  2. Estimate noise level sigma from the finest detail band via MAD
     (median absolute deviation), which is robust to outliers.
  3. Apply the universal threshold sigma * sqrt(2 * log(n)) to every
     detail band (soft or hard thresholding).
  4. Inverse transform to reconstruct the cleaned signal.

DSP note: the same pattern as denoising an audio signal — keep the coarse
envelope, squash the noisy high-frequency detail. Soft thresholding
(shrink-toward-zero) is the mean-square-error-optimal choice under Gaussian
noise; hard thresholding (keep-or-kill) preserves edges better but is
discontinuous.

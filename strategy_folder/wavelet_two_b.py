class WaveletTwoB(Strategy):
    """
    Sperandeo's 2B failed-breakout rule, but with swing highs/lows identified
    by a DSP pivot-detection pipeline instead of a fixed rolling-max lookback.

    Why this exists
    ---------------
    The plain TwoB strategy uses `high.rolling(N).max()` as the "prior swing
    high" — i.e. the highest bar in the last N bars, even if that bar is a
    single noisy spike. A human eye doesn't read charts that way: it picks
    out structural pivots and ignores tick-level chop. This class encodes
    that visual filter as a signal-processing pipeline:

        rolling causal wavelet denoise of close
            -> scipy.signal.find_peaks on the denoised series
            -> filter peaks by prominence in ATR units
            -> confirm only after `pivot_confirm_bars` of follow-through

    The 2B failed-breakout logic itself (price breaks the prior swing, then
    closes back through within `confirmation_days`) is identical to TwoB —
    only the *source of swing levels* changes.

    Causality
    ---------
    - `rolling_wavelet_denoise` is causal: denoised[t] depends only on the
      `denoise_window` bars up to and including t.
    - A peak at bar k is only treated as "known" once t >= k +
      pivot_confirm_bars. This is the group-delay analog of pivot detection:
      you don't know it was a peak until the bars after it print lower.
    - Caveat: `scipy.find_peaks` computes prominence over the full input
      array. Whether a given pivot passes the prominence gate could in
      principle shift slightly as later data arrives. The trade decision
      itself does not look ahead (it depends only on already-confirmed
      pivots and the current bar), but be aware that pivot *selection* is
      not strictly causal. A fully-causal peak finder is straightforward
      to add if you want to remove this asterisk.
